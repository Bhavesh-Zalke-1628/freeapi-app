## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Fork the Repository

Start by forking the FreeAPI project repository to your GitHub account.

### Clone Your Fork

Clone your fork of the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/apihub.git
cd apihub
```

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies of FreeAPI installed for the frontend framework or library you plan to use.

Follow this [README.md section](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary/apihub/blob/main/README.md#-installation) to know more about setting up the FreeAPI environment

## Choosing a Module <a name="choosing-a-module"></a>

Decide which module you want to contribute to. Browse the `/apps`, `/public`, or `/kitchen-sink` modules to explore the available modules and APIs. Read the following section carefully to understand the folder structure you need to follow to increase chances to get your PR approved.

## Folder Structure <a name="folder-structure-main"></a>

Follow the specified folder structure for your frontend application (**The folder names must not follow the camel casing to keep things consistent.** _Your actual project code folders may have camel casing_):

```
ROOT_FOLDER/examples/{module}/{app-name}/{platform}/{frontend-tech-used}/{project-code}
```

See the following examples with context for above structure:

## Example 1: Social Media Web App

Imagine you want to create a web application for the `social-media` project within the `/apps` module of the FreeAPI project. You've decided to use React.js for the frontend, manage state with Redux, and style the app with Tailwind CSS. Your project folder name will be a unique identifier for your application because we are not allowing same application to be built using same tech stack.

### Folder Structure:

```
$ROOT_FOLDER/examples/apps/social-media/web/react-redux-tailwind/<your_project_folders>
```

## Example 2: YouTube Mobile App

Suppose you are interested in building a mobile application that consumes the YouTube API from the `/public` folder of the FreeAPI project. For this, you've chosen Flutter as your framework, and you'll be using Riverpod for state management. Again, your project folder name will be a unique identifier for your application because we are not allowing same application to be built using same tech stack.

### Folder Structure:

```bash
$ROOT_FOLDER/examples/public/youtube/mobile/flutter-riverpod/<your_project_folders>
```

## Example 3: Status Code Lookup App

You want to contribute a frontend application to the `/kitchen-sink` module that allows users to input a numerical HTTP status code. The app will then provide details about that status code, such as its purpose and common usage with elegant UI.

## Folder Structure:

```bash
$ROOT_FOLDER/examples/kitchen-sink/statuscodes/web/react-tailwind/<your_project_folders>
```

## Explanation for the examples:

- `ROOT_FOLDER:` Refers to the root directory of the FreeAPI project.

- `examples:` This directory is designated for frontend examples.

- `{module} - apps or public or kitchen-sink:` Denotes the chosen module (`/apps` for complex apps, `/public` for public APIs, `/kitchen-sink` for backend-related static APIs. These folders are already created officially).

- `{app_name} - social-media or youtube or statuscode:` Specifies the name of the chosen app or API within the selected module. This folder is also created by default officially.

- `{platform} - web or mobile or desktop:` Defines the platform for which the frontend is developed (web or mobile or desktop etc).

- `{frontend-tech-used} - react-redux-tailwind or flutter-provider:` Indicates the frontend technology stack used, including the framework, UI-lib and state management tool (at least one tech tool name must be there).

- `<your_project_folders>:` Represents the actual project folders that will be coding.

By following this standardized folder structure, contributors can easily organize their frontend projects, making it convenient for others to explore, understand, and replicate the implementation.

## Coding Standards <a name="coding-standards"></a>

Adhere to the coding standards of the chosen frontend technology and framework. Additionally, consider the following guidelines:

- Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
- Follow best practices for state management, component structure, and code organization.
- Ensure your code is well-documented by comments wherever necessary.
- Try to use type safe languages like TypeScript over JavaScript to code the frontend
- **Include comprehensive README.md file for each project on how to do installation and setup for the respective apps**

## Dependency Management <a name="dependency-management"></a>

List all major dependencies/tech tools used in a clear and organized manner in your project README.md. Include version numbers to ensure compatibility.

## Testing (optional) <a name="testing"></a>

Write tests for your frontend application to ensure its functionality. Include instructions on how to run the tests.

## üåü Featured Projects Opportunity on FreeAPI <a name="featured-projects"></a>

We value the contributions of our community members, and we want to showcase your work! As part of our effort to highlight the creativity and diversity of the FreeAPI project, we are introducing a Featured Projects section on the official [FreeAPI](https://freeapi.app) site (under development).

## How to Get Featured <a name="get-featured"></a>

1. **Self-Host the FreeAPI Backend:**

   - Ensure that you have set up and are self-hosting the FreeAPI backend on your server. Detailed instructions can be found in the [README.md Railway one click deploy section](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary/apihub/blob/main/README.md#-using-railway-one-click-deploy). _(NOTE: You can deploy this app on server that you are comfortable with. Just make sure it is deployed and your deployed frontend can consume it's apis)_

2. **Consume FreeAPI Backend APIs in Your Frontend:**

   - In your frontend project, make sure you are consuming the relevant FreeAPI backend APIs from the deployed backend server. This demonstrates the end-to-end functionality of your application.

3. **Deploy Your Frontend:**

   - Deploy your frontend application, and ensure it is accessible via a public URL.

4. **Include Deployed Link in README.md:**
   - Add the deployed link to your frontend application at the top of the README.md file in your project code. This link will serve as the entry point for us to review and feature your project.

### Example README Section:

```markdown
<!-- other README.md content -->
<!-- make sure to keep this link at the top to make it visible -->

## Deployed Link

Visit my app: [https://my-social-media-app.example.com](https://my-social-media-app.example.com)

 <!-- other README.md content -->
```
